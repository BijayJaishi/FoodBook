# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - InstagramLogo.png
    - direct.png
    - camera.png
    - storyborder.png
    - plus_blue.png
    - more.png
    - heart.png
    - comment.png
    - save.png
    - home.png
    - search.png
    - plus.png
    - assets/image_01.png
    - assets/image_02.jpg
    - assets/image_03.jpg
    - assets/image_04.jpg
    - assets/images/burger.jpg
    - assets/images/newbackground.jpg
    - assets/images/profilebackground.png
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/images/gears.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: billabong
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/billabong.ttf
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Italic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight : 700
